#INTRODUCTION
I am Deepkumar Patel(roll no. :IMT2021011)
I am new to this github thing. But I will do my best to get good at it.

#WHAT IS THIS ABOUT
This is my project for entry in the Zense Club.
I have tried to experiment with the UI in unity.

#MY KNOWLEDGE ABOUT GAMEDEV
I also know somethings about shadergrapha, vfxgraphs, the new input system and many more.
I have actually attended a course on UDEMY by GameDev Tv and Rick Davidson.

I also have made those basic projects like 
Delivery Driver, Snow Boarding, Quiz game, TileVania and LaserDefender
These are the games included in the course

This project is rather simple but It taught me more about unity UI.
Brackeys and other youtube channels were also very helpful.

#ABOUT THE ART ASSETS
The sprites of the cards were made by myself.
only the background image for the main menu was taken from DeviantArt.com or Pinterest.com .
The sounds are the sounds I found on the internet and are in the public domain.
